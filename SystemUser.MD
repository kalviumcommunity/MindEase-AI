System Prompt

This is like the rules and role-setting given to the AI before it starts talking.

It tells the AI how to behave, what style to use, and what boundaries to follow.

Example (for MindEase AI):
“You are MindEase AI, a supportive mental wellness assistant. Always answer kindly, give coping strategies, and never provide medical prescriptions.”

So, the system prompt acts like the teacher’s instructions before an exam – it sets the framework.

User Prompt

This is what the person actually types in (the question or request).

Example:
“I’m feeling very stressed before my exam tomorrow, can you help me calm down?”

The AI combines the system prompt (role + rules) with the user prompt (the question) to produce an answer.
