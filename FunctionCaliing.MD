🔧 Function Calling in MindEase AI

Function Calling allows MindEase AI to go beyond plain text responses by invoking external tools or APIs to provide richer, more actionable support.

Instead of the model just "talking," it can call functions to fetch data, run calculations, or trigger specific actions.

🧠 Why Function Calling?

Accuracy: Ensures structured, reliable outputs instead of free text.

Interactivity: Connects AI to external resources like calendars, meditation timers, or wellness APIs.

Automation: Makes AI not just a chatbot but a personal wellness assistant.

⚙️ Example in MindEase AI

User Prompt:

"Remind me to take a break every 2 hours while studying today."

Behind the scenes:

The model detects the request involves scheduling reminders.

Instead of writing a vague response, it calls a function create_study_reminder() with structured arguments.

Function Definition:

{
  "name": "create_study_reminder",
  "description": "Sets a recurring reminder for the user",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "interval_minutes": { "type": "integer" },
      "task": { "type": "string" },
      "duration_hours": { "type": "integer" }
    },
    "required": ["interval_minutes", "task"]
  }
}


Function Call Output:

{
  "interval_minutes": 120,
  "task": "Take a break",
  "duration_hours": 8
}


System Executes → Adds reminders every 2 hours for 8 hours.
