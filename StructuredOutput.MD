STRUCTURED OUTPUT:


Structured Output means making an AI give answers in a clear and fixed format (like JSON, XML, or tables) instead of long free text.

For example, in MindEase AI, when a user says “I feel nervous before my exam”, instead of replying with a paragraph, the AI can give:

{
  "emotion_detected": "anxiety",
  "intensity_level": "moderate",
  "suggested_strategies": [
    "Practice breathing exercises",
    "Revise in short intervals",
    "Sleep early for better focus"
  ]
}


This way:

The format stays the same every time → easier for apps or dashboards to read.

Developers can connect actions like starting a meditation timer.

It avoids messy or random text, keeping responses reliable and machine-friendly.

In short, structured output = AI replies in a fixed shape that both humans and computers can easily understand and use.
