‚ö° Dynamic Prompting in MindEase AI:

MindEase AI uses Dynamic Prompting to adapt responses in real time based on the user‚Äôs input, conversation history, and external knowledge sources (via RAG).

Instead of relying on a fixed system/user prompt, MindEase AI dynamically constructs or updates prompts to ensure more personalized and context-aware support.

üîç Example:

User Prompt:

"I‚Äôm feeling stressed before my exams."

Dynamic Prompt Construction (behind the scenes):

System Prompt: "You are a supportive mental wellness assistant."

Dynamic Insert:  
- User emotion detected = "stress"  
- Context = "exam-related stress"  
- Retrieved resource = "breathing exercises from RAG knowledge base"  

Final Prompt:  
"Detect the user‚Äôs mood, identify triggers, and provide 3 coping strategies for exam-related stress. Return in JSON."


Model Output:

{
  "emotion_detected": "stress",
  "trigger": "upcoming exams",
  "strategies": [
    "Take a 10-minute break after 1 hour of studying",
    "Try the 4-7-8 breathing method before bed",
    "Make a realistic study schedule with short milestones"
  ]
}

‚ö° Benefits of Dynamic Prompting in MindEase AI:

Personalized Support: Tailors strategies to the user‚Äôs exact situation.
