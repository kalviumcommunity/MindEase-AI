🔤 Tokens and Tokenization:
📝 What are Tokens?

A token is the smallest unit of text that a language model (like GPT) can process.

Tokens can be:

Whole words (cat)

Sub-words (cater, ing)

Even punctuation (?, !)

For example:

The sentence "I love exams." may be split into tokens:

["I", " love", " exams", "."]


Different models have slightly different ways of breaking down tokens.

⚙️ What is Tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of converting raw text into tokens before feeding it into the model.

It’s like breaking a big paragraph into smaller puzzle pieces that the model understands.

In MindEase AI:

When a user says:

"I’m feeling anxious about tomorrow."

Tokenization may split it as:

["I", "’m", " feeling", " anxious", " about", " tomorrow", "."]


The model then processes these tokens to:

Detect emotion (anxious)

Recognize context (about tomorrow)

Generate structured coping strategies

📏 Why Tokens Matter?

Model Input Size: LLMs have token limits (e.g., 4k, 8k, 32k tokens). Longer conversations may hit these limits.

Cost & Efficiency: API usage is billed per token, so fewer tokens = cheaper and faster responses.

Precision: Proper tokenization ensures the AI understands user emotions correctly (e.g., splitting “stress-free” vs. “stress free”).

⚡ Example in MindEase AI:

User Prompt:

"I feel very, very sad."

Tokenization:

["I", " feel", " very", ",", " very", " sad", "."]


Model Understanding (structured output):

{
  "emotion_detected": "sadness",
  "intensity_level": "high",
  "suggested_strategies": [
    "Talk to a trusted friend or counselor",
    "Practice gratitude journaling",
    "Try a short guided meditation"
  ]
}
